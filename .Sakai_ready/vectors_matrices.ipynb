    "## Summary of assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment comprises 3 problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measure the performance of recursive determinant computation of an $n\\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "- Perform guassian elimination and measure performance\n",
    "- Compare results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imported modules like `numpy` cannot be used for this assignment, except for\n",
    "`import time`  and `import random`.\n",
    "With `time` you can use [`time_ns()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time_ns) to measure method execution time. With `random` you can use [`randint`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint) to generate random values for your matrices.\n",
    "* Treat lists as arrays: do not use list methods like `append`, `pop`, `index`, etc. \n",
    "* Access and assignment of vaues in an array should be done only with indexed references, for example `array[1][2]=3`. \n",
    "* List comprehension cannot be used except to initialize vectors/matrices as shown below.\n",
    "* An array with $m$ rows and $n$ columns can be initialized as<br/>\n",
    "`array = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]`\n",
    "* You may not use the statements `break` and `continue`\n",
    "* Methods that return a value should have one and only one `return` statement.\n",
    "* Methods that do not return a value should not have any `return` statements at all.\n",
    "* Use type hints.\n",
    "* Every method should have a docstring.\n",
    "* Methods should be further documented with comments.\n",
    "* Inline comments should be avoided.\n",
    "* Your code lines should not exceed a length of 80 characters.\n",
    "* There should be no magic values. The only literals allowed are the numbers `-1`, `0`, `1` (and their `float` variants), `None`, the empty strings `''` and `\"\"`, and the boolean literals. Everything else must be delegated to constants and variables. The only exception to this rule is numbers that implement mathematic formulae. For example $E=mc^2$ can be written as `E:float = m*c**2` though it may be *smarter* to write `E = m*c*c`.\n"

For that, you may need a third function to report the size of the matrix and the time it took to compute its determinant. That function should stop testing based on a time criterion you specify, for example after the first matrix whose determinant took more than 15 minutes to compute.\n",
