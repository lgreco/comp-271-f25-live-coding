    "Objects can be organized in hierarchies. A hierarchy is a top-to-bottom structure where elements near the top have more authority than elements below them. The word is Greek, of course, and it is used to describe the structure of a religious congregation - the root of the word is *ŒπŒµœÅœåœÇ* which means sacred. \n",

    "In Christianity for example, multiple priests report to a bishop, multiple bishops to an archbishop, and so on. Hierarchical structures have a apex point: the Pope in the Catholic Church or a Patriarch in Eastern Churches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchies exist in military, corporate, political, and many social structures as well. Physical and biological sciences as well as mathematics, legal studies, and the humanities have all hierarchies. "
