    "# The Great Chicago Donut Run \n",
    "\n",
    "The Loyola Running Club trains on a quirky **circular route** of donut stands. Each donut stand is represented as a node in a **circular singly linked list**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DonutStand:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, flavor: str) -> None:\n",
    "        self.flavor = flavor\n",
    "        self.next: \"DonutStand | None\" = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the route is circular, **the last stand’s `next` reference points back to the first stand** (the “head”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular linked lists like this show up in real systems:  \n",
    "- Operating systems use similar ideas to implement **round-robin scheduling**, repeatedly cycling through processes.  \n",
    "- Media apps can implement **looping playlists** by cycling through songs without ever hitting a “null” end.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general specifications for all parts below are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **no extra collections,** (i.e., no `import` statements)\n",
    "- Avoid infinite loops.\n",
    "- **[Programmers Pact](../ProgrammerPact_Python.pdf)** is in full effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline for this assignment:** 1 PM, Monday, December 8, 2025.\\\n",
    "**Oral followups** for randomly selected students scheduled for 1-3 PM on Monday, December 8, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flesh out the `DonutStand` class\n",
    "\n",
    "Write class `DonutStand` to include the following methods:\n",
    "- `__str__`\n",
    "- `is_flavor(target:str) -> bool:` that returns true if the stand's flavor matches the target value and false otherwise.\n",
    "- any additional methods that you may require for the rest of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flesh out a `DonutRun` class\n",
    "\n",
    "Write class `DonutRun` to simulate the donut run route described in this problem. The class should exhibit the behavior described in the following parts. Of course you may want to write additional methods to support a well-defined class. A well-defined class has little-to-no code redudancy, delegating as much common functionality as possible to methods.\n",

    "### Counting Stands Safely (4 points)\n",

    "- Traverse at most *one full loop*.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def find_chocolate(head: DonutStand | None) -> DonutStand | None:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Return the first node with flavor `\"Chocolate\"` or `None`.\n",
    "- Traverse at most *one cycle*.\n",
    "- Case-sensitive match.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Finding the Stand before the first \"Chocolate\" stand (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_before_chocolate(head: DonutStand | None) -> DonutStand | None:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    ") -> DonutStand | None:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "1. Empty list → new single-node circular list.\n",
    "2. Target found → insert after the first matching node.\n",
    "3. Target not found → insert before head (the “end”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Head must remain stable unless the list was empty.\n",
    "\n",

    "## What to submit\n",

    "Python files:\n",
    "- `DonutStand.py` with your fleshed-out donut stand class\n",
    "- `DonutRun.py` with your class simulating the donut run route, including the behavior specified above.\n"
