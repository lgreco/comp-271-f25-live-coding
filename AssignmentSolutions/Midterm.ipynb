    "- Model a real-world queue with a 2-D circular buffer.\n",
    "- Maintain **front/back** indices and **invariants** for a queue without physical shifting.\n",

    "\n",
    "A clinic uses an $n\t\\times n$ waiting room laid out in rows. New arrivals sit in the **first available seat** scanning **front→back, left→right** (row-major order). The **next person called** is always at the **front-left** seat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naïve policy (wasteful):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the front-left person leaves, **everyone shifts one seat left**; gaps at the right edge are back-filled by people from the next row; the last occupied seat becomes empty.\n",
    "- This causes approximately $n^2$ seat moves in the worst case scenario (in computer science, we use the notation $\\mathcal O(n^2)$ to indicate the approximate duration of a worst case scenario).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smart receptionist:**\n",
    "A smart receptionist at the clinic realises that there is no need to have people move to another seat everytime the next person is called. Instead, it is sufficient to track only **who arrived last** and **who is next**. Conceptually, we use the $n\\times n$ grid as a seating area where a **front of queue** and **back of queue** pointer advance in row-major order (wrapping around).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In 100-200 words, explain how **row-major order** (front→back, left→right) is implemented using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a 2-D array `self._underlying`,\n",
    "- a pair of indices `self._front`, `self._back`,\n",
    "- modular arithmetic to **advance and wrap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implement the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the queue so that it is **correct, side-effect free**, and fast. Fast here means that theres should be no shifting of elements closer to the front of the queue every time the next-in-line element is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required behaviors & constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `enqueue(value: str) -> bool`:\n",
    "  - Return `False` if full; otherwise place at `back`, advance `back` in row-major order with wrap, increment usage.\n",
    "  - **Do not** mutate other seats; **no prints**.\n",
    "- `dequeue() -> str | None`:\n",
    "  - Return `None` if empty; otherwise remove at `front`, set that cell to `None`, advance `front` with wrap, decrement usage.\n",
    "  - **No prints**; exactly one return.\n",
    "- `peek() -> str | None`: constant-time look at front.\n",
    "- `list_queue() -> list[str]`: return logical order of occupants starting at `front` over `usage` items. Must handle wrap correctly and **not** expose `None` elements.\n",
    "- ensure type hints are consistent.\n",
    "- implement special methods (dunders) for `__repr__` and `__bool__`.\n",
    "- implement getters for `usage` and `capacity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- You _may_ add private helper methos as you see fit,\n",
    "- You may not use the `import` statement.\n",
    "- Methods that return values should have one and only one `return` statement. Methods that do not return values should have no `return` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invariants\n",
    "\n",
    "- $0 \\le \t\\texttt{usage} \\le \t\\texttt{capacity}$.\n",
    "- For all occupied positions along the logical queue, cells are non-`None`; all other cells are `None`.\n",
    "- If `usage == 0` then `front == back`.  \n",

    "# SOLUTION & TECHNICAL NOTES\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code had a magic value (`n=4`) in the `__init__` arguments. This magic value was delegated to constant `_DEFAULT_SIZE` in the solution below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core lesson in this assignment is to recognize that a queue is defined by its first and last elements. As long as we know where they are, there is no need for shifting elements around every time the first element is removed from the queue. Tracking first and last element is accomplished by variables `_front` and `_back`. These are pointers to the corresponding position in an $n\\times n$ list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the _first_ item of the queue is removed, the pointer `_front` moves to the next position with a `_front += 1` operation. This, of course, may lead to an out-of-bounds index for the underlying array, so we use modulo (aka modular) arithmetic to ensure a proper wrap up and advance to the next row. As long as we allow additions to the queue while there is room (`_capacity`), this advancing and wrapping the `_front` pointer is guaranteed to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution below uses tuples to store the front and back indices, mainly to illustrate how this data structure can be used in context. Your own solutions likely use two separate `int` variables for the front (row and column) and two for the back, which is perfectly fine—and arguably clearer. In fact, using individual integer variables often makes the code easier to read and reason about than the more compact, \"Pythonic\" tuple-based approach.\n"
