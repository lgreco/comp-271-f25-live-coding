    "## Binary search in linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "Why binary search through a sorted linkedlist is not any more efficient than linear search through it. Suggest a modification to the linked list structure that will make binary search efficient. No code was required for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search in sorted _lists_ works fast because we can find the middle of the list instantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "middle:int = len(sorted_list) // 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the middle node of a _linked list_ with $n$ nodes, however, requires a traversal using a `slow` and a `fast` cursor. This takes about $n/2$ steps, i.e., it's $\\mathcal O(n)$ and therefore comparable to linear search.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a linked list more amenable to binary search (and therefore to $\\mathcal O(\\log_2 n)$ operations) we must add a third pointer in the data structure. That is, in addition to `head` that points to the first node and `tail` that points to the last node, we must add a `middle` to point to the middle node.\n"

    "```python\n",
    "def occurrences(list[int]: values, int:target) -> int:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to accept a sorted list of integer values and return how many times a target value appears on the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method must be based on binary search. It should not perform a linear scan of the entire array. It should have one and only one `return` statement. It cannot use any list techniques such as membership (`in`), `index()`, `count()` etc. In fact, the only list operation allowed is the indexed access, i.e., `values[i]`.\n"
